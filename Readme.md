# Fine-Tuning Open Source LLMs

Welcome to the **Fine-Tuning Open Source LLMs** repository, organized by **GloVersity (GloProg)**. This repository contains all the work, assignments, and code examples discussed during the **Online Sessions** aimed at helping students master the fine-tuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository is part of **Quarter 5** of the **Certified Cloud Native Applied Generative AI Engineer** program.

## Overview

The **Fine-Tuning Open Source LLMs** sessions guide learners through the process of fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models such as **Meta LLaMA 3.1** using **PyTorch**, with a focus on cloud-native training and deployment. The course covers everything from the fundamentals to advanced concepts, ensuring students acquire both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

### Instructors:
- **Abdul Qadir Imran** - Lead Instructor, DevOps Engineer (DOE)
- **Abdullah Iqbal** - Co-Instructor, Full Stack Developer (FSD)

### Learning Goals:
- Understand the architecture and capabilities of LLMs, specifically Meta LLaMA 3.1
- Set up the development environment using tools like Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, and PyTorch
- Apply fine-tuning techniques to pre-trained models
- Complete a capstone project demonstrating skills in fine-tuning and deploying LLMs on a chosen platform

Each folder contains:
- **Lecture notes**
- **Source code** used during live sessions
- **Assignments** to practice and enhance your skills
